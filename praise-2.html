<p>“During the last 2 months she provided graphical design assistance for a major air accident report. Despite only working one day a week, she produced very effective graphics in a very short turnaround time. She is quick to grasp the complicated technical concepts that the investigation team needs to display and in many cases improved upon the investigator’s ideas with design suggestions of her own. She is an extremely intuitive person with lots of initiative; in short, her support has been outstanding.”</p>
