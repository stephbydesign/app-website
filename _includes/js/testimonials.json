    "testimonial": "“I had the privilege of working with and managing Stephanie during her time at the TSB. Her photography and graphic design skills were used on multiple projects including a couple of investigations that received national media attention. Stephanie’s work and interaction with others was very professional, and she always insisted on producing the best product that she could by applying her knowledge and creativity to each project and by providing suggestions to the working group. She can be considered to be a positive asset on any project to which she is assigned.”",

    "testimonial": "“During the last 2 months she provided graphical design assistance for a major air accident report. Despite only working one day a week, she produced very effective graphics in a very short turnaround time. She is quick to grasp the complicated technical concepts that the investigation team needs to display and in many cases improved upon the investigator’s ideas with design suggestions of her own. She is an extremely intuitive person with lots of initiative; in short, her support has been outstanding.”",
