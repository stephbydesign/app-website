<p>“I had the privilege of working with and managing Stephanie during her time at the TSB. Her photography and graphic design skills were used on multiple projects including a couple of investigations that received national media attention. Stephanie’s work and interaction with others was very professional, and she always insisted on producing the best product that she could by applying her knowledge and creativity to each project and by providing suggestions to the working group. She can be considered to be a positive asset on any project to which she is assigned.”</p>
